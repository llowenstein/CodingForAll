			Coding for all is a BCIT club which meets regularily to discuss coding
			related topics. The topics are suggested and decided upon as a group. 
			Topics range from crash courses in software to discussing the best 
			approaches to succeeding in the 1st semester of the CST program. The 
			group strives for maximum accessibility and exposure. We are seeking
			to support a volunteer based non-profit community, which is able to
			provide equal opportunities to all members. We are not limited to 
			currently enrolled students; however, we will have a primary focus on
			BCIT students with alumni and prospective students as supporting 
			members.
